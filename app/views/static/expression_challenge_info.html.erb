  <h2>Expression Challenge</h2>
  <p class="flow-text">Your Expression Challenge is the
numerological or arithmantic sum of your Soul
Urge Challenge and Personality Challenge
(which we’ll dive into in a moment). This,
however, does not mean that it can be
understood simply by reading one and then
the other, and putting them together.</p>
  <p class="flow-text">Your Expression Challenge is synergetic,
which means that it is a unique vibration that is
distinct and greater than the sum of two that
combine to create it. It describes the overall
challenges of your way of being in the world.</p>
  <p class="flow-text">You can work with this challenge without it
affecting your Soul Urge or Personality
challenges. We recommend work with your
Expression first because it has a larger overall
effect – people usually know more about the
real you through the Expression than through
the separate components of it, your Soul Urge
and Personality.</p>
  <p class="flow-text">Once again, in numerology, a challenge is not
some kind of counter-force that works against
your happiness, success or well- being. It is a
way of gaining “extra credit” or “bonus points”
in the game of life. As it is often said: “What
you send out into the world is what you get
back.” Trust the power of your Expression and
you will thrive.
