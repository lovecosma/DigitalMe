  <h2>Personality Challenge Number</h2>
  <p class="flow-text">As mentioned earlier, some numerologists treat the Personality Number as relating only to the
visible aspects of the self, while others treat it as a hidden yet motivating aspect of your
personality that engineers the visible aspects, and therefore call it the “Quiet Self”.</p>
<p class="flow-text">No matter which view you take, your Persona, or attitude and thoughts about yourself, can affect
your health, prosperity, relationships, and all other matters connected to your wellbeing. Your
Persona is built up from experience, which is the feedback the universe gives you about your
choices, thoughts, words and deeds.</p>
<p class="flow-text">In every circumstance and situation, your Persona’s job is to interpret your subconscious or
Soul’s perception and integrate it into your conscious mind to decide on what action to take.
Sometimes this will evoke a response that is in line with its numerological value, and other times
it can generate angry, self-critical, defensive or defeatist thoughts.</p>
<p class="flow-text">These thoughts and emotions may sabotage your plans or stop their momentum. At the very
least, they will be visible in your behaviors to those who care about you. When you choose to
ignore this challenge, you suppress the psychic energy within you, which can result in
disturbances to your wellbeing, body and mind. Again, it’s important to remember that a
challenge is not a threat. It simply illuminates an opportunity to improve your overall
circumstances and support the expression of the power in your name.</p>
