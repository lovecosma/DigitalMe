  <h2>Soul Urge Challenge Number</h2>
  <p class="flow-text">Generally, your Soul Urge does not create negative manifestations. However, every individual Soul faces different resistance and riction with the vibrations of the material and others around them. This resistance can interfere with your happiness only when you are not allowing the Soul Urge to be an active and conscious part of life, not expressing it fully, or not working with (or are in denial about) your Soul Urge Challenge.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="flow-text">In a numerology chart, a “challenge” of any
type is not the retribution of a vengeful
universe, but a tool provided by nature to
help you overcome weaknesses and live your
best life. It is an indicator of the friction one
with your particular chart my encounter.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="flow-text">The Soul Urge Challenge reveals how to work
with your natural shortcomings so that you
can achieve the balance and fulfillment you
seek. When you consciously work with the
Challenge, instead of against it, the Soul will
be able to express itself more easily. By
putting forth some effort to consciously
handle this aspect of your soul’s growth, you
automatically summon more creative,
intuitive and ecstatic energy from the
essence of who you are which will enhance
your life in every way. Life can be an exciting
adventure if you call upon the Soul, the
essence of all you are, to come out and play.</p>

    “To be aware of a single shortcoming within oneself is more useful than to be aware of a
thousand in somebody else.”
