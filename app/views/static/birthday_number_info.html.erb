  <h2>Birthday Number Meaning</h2>

  <p class="flow-text ">Your Birthday number is one of only five numbers in your Numerology that are called "core numbers." They are derived from either your name or birth date and are the numbers that influence you most strongly throughout your life. As one of these important numbers, your Birthday number can reveal unique and powerful abilities that you naturally possess -- like a gift you have to offer the world. It’s also known as the “Pychic” or “Ruling” Number because it reveals an in depth understanding of your true self. In many ways, it explains the nature of your existence and makes sense of the events that unfold in your life.</p>
  <p class="flow-text">Luckily, this is also the easiest Numerology number to calculate! All you need to know is a person's birthday, because the Birthday number is simply the day of the month on which they were born. If you were born on the 8th, your Birthday number is 8. If you were born on the 29th, your number is 29. This is one of the few cases in Numerology where double-digit numbers are not reduced to a single digit number. This means your Birthday number could be any number 1-31. Keep reading to see the meaning of your birth date and what it reveals about your life!</p>
