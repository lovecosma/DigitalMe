  <h2>Birthday Number Meaning</h2>

  <p class="flow-text ">Your Birthday number is one of only five numbers in your Numerology that are called "core numbers." They are derived from either your name or birth date and are the numbers that influence you most strongly throughout your life. As one of these important numbers, your Birthday number can reveal unique and powerful abilities that you naturally possess -- like a gift you have to offer the world. It’s also known as the “Pychic” or “Ruling” Number because it reveals an in depth understanding of your true self. In many ways, it explains the nature of your existence and makes sense of the events that unfold in your life.</p>
  <p class="flow-text">Luckily, this is also the easiest Numerology number to calculate! All you need to know is a person's birthday, because the Birthday number is simply the day of the month on which they were born. If you were born on the 8th, your Birthday number is 8. If you were born on the 29th, your number is 29. This is one of the few cases in Numerology where double-digit numbers are not reduced to a single digit number. This means your Birthday number could be any number 1-31. Keep reading to see the meaning of your birth date and what it reveals about your life!</p>

  <p class="flow-text">Your Birth Day Number is calculated by reducing the sum of your birth day to a single digit.</p><br>

  <div class="white-text wrapper indigo accent-4">
    <p class="flow-text">Here’s an example:</p><br>
    <ul class="flow-text">
      <li>* Someone born the 28th day of any month will have a Birth Day Number of 1.</li><br>
      <li>* We arrive at that number by adding the two digits of the birth day together.</li><br>
      <li>* So, 2 + 8 = 10</li><br>
      <li>* Since the result is a double digit sum, we continue adding until we arrive at a single digit.</li><br>
      <li>* So, 1 + 0 = 1</li><br>
      <li>* In this example, the Birth Day Number is 1.</li><br>
    </ul>
  </div><br>

  <p class="flow-text">If you were born on the 11th or 22nd of any month, or if any of your calculations sum to total 11 or
22, there’s no need to continue reducing. The calculation stops there. 11 and 22 are Master
Numbers and they have a unique meaning that require stand-alone readings.</p><br>

<div class="white-text wrapper indigo accent-4">
  <p class="flow-text">Here's an example</p>
  <ul class="flow-text">
    <li>* Someone born on the 29th of any month will have a Birth Day Number of 11.</li><br>
    <li>* 2 + 9 = 11</li><br>
    <li>* The calculation stops there since the result, albeit a double digit, is the Master Number 11.</li><br>
  </ul>

<p class="flow-text">Unlike the numbers derived from your name, your Birth Day Number will never change. It is a
static number that interacts with your Life Path to create different vibrational cycles you’ll
naturally experience throughout the duration of your life. It’s so powerful, that some expert
numerologists suggest name changes that are based on the Birth Day Number to improve one’s
inherent luck and overall happiness
</p><br>
<p class="flow-text">To account for the major impact the Birth Day Number has on your Life Path, we’ve gone above
and beyond the standard numerology readings you’ll find elsewhere. Your reading below
includes information not only about your specific Birth Day Number, including your Birth Day
Gifts and Challenges, but also examines how your unique Birth Day and Life Path Numbers
combine to massively influence your life. Just like the degrees on a compass reveal the direction
you’re facing and the quickest path to your destination, your Birth Day Number decodes the
shortcut to your ideal Life Path.</p>
<p class="flow-text">
It defines how you will handle the opportunities and challenges that present themselves
throughout your adult life. Intimately understanding and aligning with this vibration in your chart
can help you make better and more empowering decisions in all areas of your life and open the
road to more success, happiness and prosperity.</p>
<p class="flow-text">Through numerology, we have a way of glimpsing into the secret depths of the Soul by reading,
understanding and honoring the Soul Urge Number, which is defined as being the longing of the
inner self. You may know what this longing is for you, but may not express it, either by choice or
because of blocks or current life circumstances.</p>
<p classs="flow-text">This is why it’s so important to learn about your Soul Urge. The more you know and understand, the easier it is to express the desires of your unique Soul.</p>
<p class="flow-text">Many numerologists also look to the Soul Urge Number to understand your relationship style and the challenges to fulfillment you may encounter in relationships. Either way, to honor the Soul Urge is to achieve a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment in all aspects of life.</p>
